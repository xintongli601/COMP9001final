## User Instructions

This is a simple, command-line version of Blackjack. The user plays against the computer (dealer).

3. You can choose to view your past records, the amount previous players have won or lost.

4. Enter your name 

5. Select a difficulty mode:

Easy (E): Dealer plays normally.

Hard (H): Dealer plays more aggressively (keeps drawing if their total is below yours).

6. Buy Chips

You must buy chips in order to play the game. The minimum purchase is $20 because the minimum bet for each hand is $20.

7. Place a Bet

Before each round, you place a bet (minimum $20 and up to your total chips).

Both you and the dealer get two cards.
You can see both of your cards but only one of the dealer's cards is shown, the other is hidden for now.

9. You decide to Hit (H) (draw a card) or Stand (S) (keep your total).
    
If your total is 21 at some point, you win the hand. 
But if your total goes over 21, you bust and lose your bet. 
Don't worry! The program calculates your total for you!
It will always be your turn before you choose to stand or get a total over 21.

Occasionally, a Lucky Event may occur: You might get a free Ace. (greater possibility to win)
