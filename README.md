# üÉè Blackjack Game in Python

This is a simple, command-line version of Blackjack. The user plays against the computer (dealer). 

Here's how it works step by step:

1. Start the Game

You're welcomed to the Blackjack table.

You can choose to view your past records.

Enter Your Name & Choose Difficulty

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter a nickname.

Then, select a difficulty mode:

Easy (E): Dealer plays normally.

Hard (H): Dealer plays more aggressively (keeps drawing if their total is below yours).

Buy Chips

You must buy chips to play. The minimum purchase is $20.

Place a Bet

Before each round, you place a bet (minimum $20 and up to your total chips).

Card Dealing

Both you and the dealer get two cards.

One of the dealer‚Äôs cards is shown; the other is hidden.

Your Turn

You decide to Hit (H) (draw a card) or Stand (S) (keep your total).

If your total goes over 21, you bust and lose your bet.

Dealer‚Äôs Turn

Dealer draws cards until their total is at least 17, or in Hard mode, until they beat your total.

Lucky Events

Occasionally, a Lucky Event may occur:

You might get a free Ace.

The dealer might receive a strong card.

Result & Chips Update

If you win: you gain the bet amount.

If you lose: you lose the bet.

If it‚Äôs a tie: no chips are lost.

Keep Playing or Quit

After each round, you can decide to keep playing.

If your chips drop below $20, you can buy more.

Game End & Score Saving

Your performance (profit or loss) is saved to blackjack_score.txt.

You can view past game records anytime.
